![Epic Hacker Photo](https://github.com/SethConnell/Python-GitHub-Hack/blob/master/hack.gif?raw=true)

This hack installer was written in Python. It's an easy installer that helps you make your GitHub account look more awesome by spamming your contribution chart with fake data to make you look like a better programmer.

# How to Start:
Fist, create your own empty repository on GitHub.
Copy the link to your repository and save it as the variable "linktorepo" in the settings.py file
Replace the email variable with your own in the same file as well.
Save everything.
Run go.py and let the fun begin! :grin::grin::grin:


### Please Note:
Special thanks to Priansh Shah [https://github.com/pshah123] for doing the heavy lifting development so I wouldn't have to figure it out myself :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
